# Heyyo!:wave:

I am Shreyas Nidugala (he/him). Here is some info about me:

Senior CS student at NMAMIT. I used to freelance as a 3D look development artist and motion designer. I like long-distance running, building and repairing computers. Also, I produce music and write songs and am a huge nerd bout DSP and in-the-box audio engineering :)
