# Heyyo!:wave:

I am Shreyas Nidugala (he/him). Here is some info about me:

Currently a Comp Sci senior in NMAMIT Nitte, India. Exploring many domains with these projects on here. I also do 3D design, animation, compositing, anything and everything Adobe CC can be used for. I produce music as well. Big nerd about DSP and plugin development but gotta find some time to do that.
